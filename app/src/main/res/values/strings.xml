Their job is to have their teammates guess which word is displayed.\nThe person describing the word can say anything besides a word that is part of the word or something that rhymes with the word.\nWhen their team guesses the word they pass the phone to the right.\nThen the other team does the same. This continues until the time runs out.\nA message will appear onscreen to say when the time is up.\nWhichever team does not have the phone in their hands at this time gets a point.\nThe settings can be adjusted so people can play first team to 2 through 10 points.\n \n\n\n\n\n</string>
